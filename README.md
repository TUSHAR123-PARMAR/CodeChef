Skill Swap
Problem Statement: 
Project Title: TaalMel – Learn. Teach. Repeat.

In every home, college, office, or neighborhood, there’s someone who knows something you don’t — and wants to learn something you do. A student who can build a website might want to learn how to cook. A homemaker with years of wisdom in managing a family might want to understand how to use Excel. A grandparent who tells the best stories might want to learn how to use a smartphone. And a busy professional might be secretly dreaming of learning classical dance or painting.

But despite this treasure chest of everyday skills, there’s no simple, trusted space where people from different backgrounds and age groups can come together to exchange knowledge — skill for skill, time for time, with no money involved.

That’s where TaalMel comes in. Meaning "harmony" in Hindi, TaalMel is a skill-swap platform built to connect people from all walks of life — students, professionals, homemakers, and grandparents — and give them a place to learn, teach, and grow together.

With features like easy profile creation, skill listings, smart matching based on needs and time, swap requests, ratings, and a warm, user-friendly interface, TaalMel turns the act of learning into a shared experience. It’s not just about gaining a skill — it’s about building a community where learning has rhythm, teaching has purpose, and connection has meaning.

Because sometimes, the best teacher is just one conversation away.
